# Music Practice

Based on [Vue3 Quickstart](http://vue3quickstart.rf.gd/), a no-compile approach to VueJS.

Born of an urge to learn sight reading, and a desire to try out new technologies.

The current version selects notes randomly, optionally either displaying or playing them. Response is provided either by clicking the on-screen keyboard, or plugging in a midi device.

Upcoming features might include various chords and clefs, spaced repetitions, non-random notes i.e. actual music sheets.
